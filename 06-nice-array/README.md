Problem: 
Test whether an input array is a Nice array. A Nice array is defined as: for each value in the array there is at least one value that is numerically adjacent to it, that is (value + 1) or (value - 1) is found in the array. Return true if the array is Nice, return false if it is not Nice or if the input array is empty.
