Code Wars challenge: 
https://www.codewars.com/kata/highest-scoring-word

Problem: 
Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.
Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.
You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.
If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.

The instructions also say:
All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.
But some of the random tests include inputs like a string of three spaces, and I might quibble about their validity.
